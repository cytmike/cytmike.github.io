Python does not have pointers, unlike C or C++.

It does not have direct access to memory using & or * operators. However since there is no need to assign variable types, it is possible to still create linked lists for example.

Everything like malloc or delete is hidden from programmers, so there is no worries for memory handling or memory leaks.
