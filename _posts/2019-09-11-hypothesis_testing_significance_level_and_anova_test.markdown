This post is going to discuss about significance level and ANOVA test.

In hypothesis testing,  the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is nothing new happening, it is denoted by H0.

Alternative hypothesis is a position that states something is happening, a new theory is true instead of an old one (null hypothesis). It is denoted by H1 or Ha.

Significance level is the basis of every test. Without significance level, nothing can be tested about null hypothesis and hence no conclusions can be drawn.
