Prime numbers, Fibonacci numbers, or even natural numbers ... I have always had an interest in numbers.

I went to college majoring in Mathematics, however data science as a career was not evolved yet back then.

In recent years, I am running my own business that involves reselling merchant gift cards. I have to always know about pricing analytics. I was reading about different models online, until I found out that I could actually study Data Science formally.

Throughout the class, I am able to see a lot of math and proofs, which I haven't seen since college. It will be interesting to see how these techniques can be used in real world as a data scientist.
