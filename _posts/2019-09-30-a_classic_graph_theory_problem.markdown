Section 42 of the curriculum is about graph theory. This blogpost presents a classic problem from graph theory. It is called the seven bridges problem. 

It is from a Prussia city called KÃ¶nigsberg, which is now Kaliningrad in Russia. As shown in the picture below, there is a river and two islands.
