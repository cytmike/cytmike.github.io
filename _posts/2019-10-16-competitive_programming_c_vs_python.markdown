I participated a programming contest on campus recently.

I have been using C++ almost exclusively in competitions for the last 15 years. It is short to write and quick to run.

I only started learning Python this year, because of this bootcamp. It is interesting to see the power of Python, especially it does not require any data types.

Going forward, I will try to write the same program in both languages, in order to practice writing Python.
