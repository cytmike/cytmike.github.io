I have been using C++ almost exclusively in competitions for the last 15 years. It is short to write and quick to run.

I participated a programming contest on campus recently, perhaps it is my first time writing Python in a competition setting.

I only started learning Python this year, because of this bootcamp. It is interesting to see the power of Python, especially it does not require any data types.

The advantage of Python is that it has a lot more built-in functions, such as numpy and scikit-learn.

I am not yet fluent enough to write everything I want in Python, but that should be my goal.

Going forward, I will try to write the same program in both languages, in order to practice writing Python.
