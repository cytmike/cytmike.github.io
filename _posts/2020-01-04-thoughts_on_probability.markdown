Towards Data Science is a good blog with a lot of Data Science resources.

It is a blog with useful information for all data science students.

It is hosted on Medium, so it is constantly asking for paid subscription, it can be bypassed with Private Browsing on Firefox however.

Recently I am reading on this about statistics.
