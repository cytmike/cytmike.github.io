Towards Data Science is a good blog with a lot of Data Science resources.

It is a blog with useful information for all data science students.

It is hosted on Medium, so it is constantly asking for paid subscription, it can be bypassed with Private Browsing on Firefox however.

My goal is to read an article on there every day (or 2 days).

Recently I am reading on this about statistics.

Hypothesis testing, distribution and statstical significance are important concepts that I always forget about, I need to review these more often. 

Each test has 1 control group and 1 experiment group. With hypothesis testing, a level of 5% is usually used to accept or reject.
