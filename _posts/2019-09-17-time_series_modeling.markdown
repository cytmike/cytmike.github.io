How to predict the future with past data? This is what time series forecasting is about.

In Module 4 project, my task is to act as a consultant for a real estate investment firm. The dataset contains data obtained from Zillow research with home prices in 14723 zip codes from April 1996 to April 2018. That is 22 years of data.

Some of the zip codes have missing data. There is no good way to project those missing values, hence I removed them from the data set.
